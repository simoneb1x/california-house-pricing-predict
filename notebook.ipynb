    "You could use your web browser to download it, and run tar xzf housing.tgz to decompress the file and extract the CSV file, but it is preferable to create a small func‐ tion to do that. It is useful in particular if data changes regularly, as it allows you to write a small script that you can run whenever you need to fetch the latest data (or you can set up a scheduled job to do that automatically at regular intervals). Auto‐ mating the process of fetching the data is also useful if you need to install the dataset on multiple machines."
